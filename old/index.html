        <h2>Shallow / Deep copy</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the
            same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of
            the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when
            you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the
            other object to change too â€” and so, you may end up unintentionally
            causing changes to the source or copy that you don't expect. That
            behavior contrasts with the behavior of a deep copy, in which the
            source and copy are completely independent.
          </p>

          <p>
            In JavaScript, standard built-in object-copy operations (spread
            syntax, Array.prototype.concat(), Array.prototype.slice(),
            Array.from(), Object.assign(), and Object.create()) do not create
            deep copies (instead, they create shallow copies).
          </p>

          <p>
            One way to make a deep copy of a JavaScript object, if it can be
            serialized, is to use JSON.stringify() to convert the object to a
            JSON string, and then JSON.parse() to convert the string back into a
            (completely new) JavaScript object.

        <h2>Primitive Value</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is
            not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7
            primitive data types: string number bigint boolean undefined symbol
            null

            "Array.length = value" will delete elements in Value is less than
            the Array's actual length.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some methods treat empty spots as undefined, and some skip them. It
            depends on the method - older methods tend to skip, while newer ones
            use Undefined.

        <h2>?? Operator (Nullish Coalescing)</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            The JavaScript double question mark (??) operator is called the
            nullish coalescing operator and it provides a default value when a
            variable or an expression evaluates to null or undefined.
