          A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same
          references (point to the same underlying values) as those of the
          source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you
          change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other
          object to change too â€” and so, you may end up unintentionally causing
          changes to the source or copy that you don't expect. That behavior
          contrasts with the behavior of a deep copy, in which the source and
          copy are completely independent.

          In JavaScript, standard built-in object-copy operations (spread
          syntax, Array.prototype.concat(), Array.prototype.slice(),
          Array.from(), Object.assign(), and Object.create()) do not create deep
          copies (instead, they create shallow copies).
        </span>,
        <span>
          One way to make a deep copy of a JavaScript object, if it can be
          serialized, is to use JSON.stringify() to convert the object to a JSON
          string, and then JSON.parse() to convert the string back into a
          (completely new) JavaScript object.

          Some methods treat empty spots as undefined, and some skip them. It
          depends on the method - older methods tend to skip, while newer ones

        <span>
          The JavaScript double question mark (??) operator is called the
          nullish coalescing operator and it provides a default value when a
          variable or an expression evaluates to null or undefined.
